# FILL KAREL

Your task is to help Karel fill the world with beepers, regardless of its size.

For example, consider Karel's starting 5x5 world. When complete it should look like this:

Note that Karel's final position does matter. Karel should be in the top-right corner facing right. You can assume that Karel always starts in the bottom-left corner, facing right. Your code needs to work on more than just a 5x5 world. For example if you run your solution on the 3x4 world

The result should still be a world filled with beepers:
