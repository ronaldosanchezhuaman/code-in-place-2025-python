Congratulations on beginning your coding journey! Karel welcomes you to Code in Place 2025. Your next task is to help Karel celebrate the occasion by placing 20 beepers, moving Karel one step, placing 25 beepers, and moving Karel one more step. The world should ultimately look like this

There are many ways to get this correct. In order to program this well you should be using two for loops. Recall that a for loop looks like this:

    for i in range(100):
        # things to repeat
        move()

This for loops repeats move 100 times. What do you want to repeat, and how many times?
