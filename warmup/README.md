Your task: Write a program in the editor, that makes Karel move, pick a beeper, then move.

Your program should have a main function with three commands:

    2. pick_beeper()
    3. move()

When you hit the run button, your program will execute line-by-line. After it finishes, Karel's world should look like this:
