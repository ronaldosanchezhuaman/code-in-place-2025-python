# Multiply Two Numbers

Write a Python program that takes two integer inputs from the user and calculates the value of the first number multiplied with the second. The program should perform the following tasks:

After printing "This program multiplies two numbers."

    1. Prompt the user to enter the first number.
    2. Read the input and convert it to an integer.
    3. Prompt the user to enter the second number.
    4. Read the input and convert it to an integer.
    5. Calculate the value of multiplying the two numbers.
    6. Print the value

Here is a full run of the program (user input is in blue)

    This program multiplies two numbers.
    Enter first number: 20
    Enter second number: 3
    60

In order to pass the tests you will need very specific prompts:

    num1 = input("Enter first number: ")
    num2 = input("Enter second number: ")

Don't forget to change these two values into integers.
